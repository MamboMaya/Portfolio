# Portfolio

This is the repo for my portfolio, which can be viewed at www.damienmaya.com . As I continue to learn new languages and add more to my arsenal, I will update and add what I have learned.

On the website, you will notice three sections to exhibit my projects, my personal blog, and the tools that I am comfortable working with. I am committing more time to writing in my blog so all readers get a better understanding of who I am.

#HELP:
I openly welcome any and all advice/suggestions for either this portfolio or my career in general. So if you're reading this and see something that you would do differently, please feel free to reach out to me and let me know what I am doing wrong. I am all ears.  
You can email me at damien_maya@yahoo.com 


I hope you enjoy! 

Cheers.
